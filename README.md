# Polyservice 
## The easiest way to write microservices
Polyservice takes the headache out of implementing microservices! 
This Fast, Scalable framework allows developers to focus on building buisness logic without the hassle of re-writing http, socket, or RPC interfaces.

Polyservice is easy to use!
1. Define your service
2. Define and register your methods
3. Register your service
4. Run!

Polyservice includes the following IO capabilities
* HTTP - express
* Sockets - socket.io
* Command Line - Yargs
* RPC - gRPC
